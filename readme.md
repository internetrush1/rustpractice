# Cash Convert

## Current
Practicing with Rust, creating a cash converter where you put in the different types of currency and Rust does the addition conversion etc. 

## Future 
Thinking about creating an api based service that automatically converts and calculates the best possible service to convert money into a different amount for different countries.
